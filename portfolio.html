    <h1>   </h1>Our project consists of multiple shapes being created inside each other, with each shape having its corners be different shapes and colors. After these shapes are created a replicate of said shapes are created in only white giving the illusion of the shapes disappearing. Once all the shapes have “disappeared” the shapes are recreated to the right giving the illusion of teleportation. Once the new shapes are created the program ends.
